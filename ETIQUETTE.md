# UtahJS Slack Etiquette Guide

- Be friendly:
	- Welcome new members!
	- Be respectful and friendly when giving coding advice.
	- Remember we are all unpaid; we help to give back to the community.
	- Avoid being bossy.
- Respect opinions:
	- Avoid talking condescendingly about frameworks, technologies or programming languages.
	- People are not their code; don't bully others because you don't like their code.
- Avoid bloating channels:
	- Use direct messages for one-on-one banter.
	- Embrace Slack's new Post feature for long posts.
	- Use code snippets to share code.
	- Use threads to keep tangents out of the channel.
	- Avoid overusing gifs.
