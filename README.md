# The Code of Conduct for the UtahJS Slack Workspace

All participants in the UtahJS Slack channel are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Verbal or written offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
UtahJS Slack Workspace admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

UtahJS Slack Workspace admins have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to public channels, private channels and direct messages.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the UtahJS Slack Workspace admins at coc@utahjs.com or by sending a direct message to an admin:

- @kendsnyder - Ken Snyder
- @waltercodes - Walter Scott
- @spicydonuts - Michael Trotter

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The workspace admins are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

UtahJS Slack Workspace admins who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
