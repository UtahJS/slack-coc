# The Code of Conduct for the UtahJS Slack Workspace

All participants in the UtahJS Slack channel are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Complaints will be reviewed in a timely and professional manner and responses may include banning users from the workspace.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members and contributors pledge to make our community and any projects related to it a safe and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment or insensitivity related to age, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance or body size, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, ethnicity or race, or religion
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Etiquette

We encourage everyone to review and follow the [Slack Etiquette Guide](https://github.com/UtahJS/slack-coc/blob/master/ETIQUETTE.md).

## Advertisements

Marketing or promotional material is allowed but it must be infrequent, short, and posted in _public_ channels relevant to the content. *No unsolicited direct messages* promoting yourself, your company, your product, or your event.

Moderators may elect to remove accounts which are known to exclusively post promotional material.

A bot may *never* post marketing material in any channel without prior approval.

## Our Responsibilities

UtahJS Slack Workspace admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

UtahJS Slack Workspace admins have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to public channels, private channels and direct messages.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported in any of three ways:

1. Anonymously using [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEjy-OM3GabFlrIJb5XnOyWiLFsGT4Jxouw5r9cmLJvllShA/viewform)
1. By emailing coc@utahjs.com
1. By sending a Slack message to an admin listed below:
  - @kendsnyder - Ken Snyder
  - @waltercodes - Walter Scott
  - @Madeline - Madeline Trotter

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The workspace admins are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

UtahJS Slack Workspace admins who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
